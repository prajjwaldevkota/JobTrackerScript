# Job Applications Email Tracker üì¨

A Python script to automatically track your job application emails from Gmail and export them to an Excel spreadsheet.

## üì¶ What It Does

- **Connects** to your Gmail account via IMAP  
- **Searches only** the **Primary** category for messages sent after a specified date  
- **Filters** for application-related messages (applied, interview invites, offers, rejections)  
- **Deduplicates** by IMAP UID and existing records  
- **Extracts** the email‚Äôs actual sent date, job title, company name, and status  
- **Appends** new entries to `job_applications.xlsx`  

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Primary-only fetch** using Gmail‚Äôs `X-GM-RAW "category:primary"` search  
- **Keyword filtering**: include only application-centric subjects, exclude noise (e.g. recruiter pitches, newsletters)  
- **Robust parsing**: regex patterns to extract job title and company from email subject lines  
- **Deduplication**: avoids reprocessing messages using persistent IMAP UID and historical record comparison  
- **Excel output**: stores structured data in a `.xlsx` file for easy review and tracking  

---

## üîß Prerequisites

- Python **3.7 or higher**
- Gmail account with **IMAP enabled**
- A Gmail **App Password** (required if using two-factor authentication)

### Required Python packages

```bash
pip install openpyxl
pip install pandas 
```
Pandas is optional

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit the top of `job_tracker.py` and set the following variables:

```python
EMAIL       = "your_email@gmail.com"
APP_PASSWORD= "your_app_password"
IMAP_SERVER = "imap.gmail.com"
EXCEL_FILE  = "job_applications.xlsx"
DATE_LIMIT  = "YYYY-MM-DD"   # e.g. "2024-10-01"
```

## üì• Installation

1.  **Clone or download the repository:** Obtain the `job_tracker.py` script and any associated files. You can do this by cloning the Git repository if available, or by downloading the files directly.

2.  **Install dependencies:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the `job_tracker.py` file, and run the following command to install the necessary library:

    ```bash
    pip install openpyxl
    ```

    This command will install the `openpyxl` library, which is required for the script to work with Excel files.

3.  **Enable IMAP in Gmail:**
    * Go to your Gmail settings. You can usually find this by clicking the gear icon in the top right corner and then selecting "See all settings".
    * Navigate to the **Forwarding and POP/IMAP** tab.
    * Ensure that **IMAP access** is enabled. If it's disabled, select "Enable IMAP" and click "Save Changes".

4.  **Generate and save App Password:**
    * Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).
    * Navigate to the **Security** section.
    * Under "How you sign in," find and click on **App passwords**. (You might need to have 2-Step Verification enabled for this option to appear.)
    * Select "Mail" from the "Select the app" dropdown.
    * Select "Other (Custom name)" from the "Select the device" dropdown and enter a name like "Job Tracker".
    * Click **Generate**. This will provide you with a 16-digit App Password.
    * **Copy this App Password.**
    * Open the `job_tracker.py` file in a text editor.
    * Locate the line `APP_PASSWORD= "your_app_password"` and replace `"your_app_password"` with the App Password you just generated, ensuring you keep the quotation marks:

        ```python
        APP_PASSWORD= "your_generated_app_password"
        ```
        or add an env file and you can change it there.
    * Save the `job_tracker.py` file.
  
    ## üé¨ Usage
